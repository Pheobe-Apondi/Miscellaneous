    <p>Hello! My name is Pheobe Gloria Apondi. I am an aspiring software engineer currently enrolled in a codehive program.
      I have been in the program for around 3 weeks and I've learnt a lot in the short time. 
      I would like to share some of the things I have learnt,
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> The program runs for 10 months and it has been broken down into components. We have nine classes and I'll be taking you through what they entail.
        The nine classes include:
        <ol>
            <li> UX Research</li>
            <li> UI/UX Design</li>
            <li> Data Structures and Systems Architecture</li>
            <li> Front-End Mobile Development</li>
            <li> Front-End Web Development</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li> Product Management</li>
            <li>Quality Assurance</li>
            <li> Navigating your journey</li>
     </ol>
     The classes have been enlightening. I've learnt so much and I'm excited to learn more. I will explore each class in detail and the lessons that havre accrued.
    </p>
    <h2>UX Research</h2>
    <p>This class is all about research. I know when you come across the word "research", all you can picture is a lot of paper work. 
        I promise you, there's more to it. In this class we try to understand users' needs, wants, behaviours and painpoints.
    </p>

    <p> To be able to create a good tech product, it is essential that we understand the end users of our product. This results in us creating 
        a product users want and also saving money.
        These are some of the things I have learn't so far:

        <ul>
            <Li>Our products should be a human centred design, meaning we should keep our users in mind when building the product.</Li>
            <Li>There are two methods of research, primary and secondary method. In primary we collect data ourselves and in secondary we get it from another source.</Li>
            <Li>There are different types of research e.g descriptive and evaluative.</Li>
            <Li>There are different data collection methods e.g observation and interviews</Li>
            <Li> The best approach to research is to use the two methods of research i.e primary and secondary.</Li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>UI/UX Design</h2>
    In this class it is all about the visual representation of a product and how that product makes the users feel.
    It is still human centered. We focus on creating visual elements that will appeal to the user of a tech product and also ensuring that 
    the user has a good experience while using the application.
    Here are some of the things I have learnt.
    <ul>
       <li>There are different elements of design e.g shapes, colors and textures</li>
       <li> Design has different principles that one must follow e.g balance and dominance</li>
       <li>You don't need to be an artist to be a designers, designers solve problems</li>
       <li>Mortifs: These are designs that can be recreated. They can be repeated to create a pattern</li>
       <li> There are design tools e.g Figma that are used to create designs</li>
       
    </ul>
    <h2>Data Structures and Systems Architecutre</h2>
    <p>This is by far my favorite class! The trainor has a way of making her classes lively and digestible!
        Here are some of the things I've learnt so far:
        <ul>
            <li>Components of a computer e.g CPU,Memory, battery</li>
            <li>How to take care of my computer so that it serves me well</li>
            <li>How memory works</li>
            <li>Data structures specifically arrays</li>
            <li>How time and space are calculated </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Front-End Mobile Development</h3>
     <p>In this class we learn how to code the front end of mobile applications. We are using Kotlin language.
     These are the things we have learnt so far:
     <ul>
        <li>Data types e.g arrays</li>
        <li>Kotlin Operators</li>
        <li>Variables</li>
        <li>Kotlin Functions</li>
        <li>How to use github</li>
     </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Front-End Web Development</h3>
    <p>In this class we are taught how to code the front end of a web application using html,css and javascript.
    Here is what we have learn't so far.
    <ul>
     <li> Creating forms</li>
     <li>Creating tables</li>
     <li>Coding a webpage</li>
     <li>Hosting a webpage</li>
     <li>Basic html and css</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
   <h3>Python</h3>
      <p> Here we learn how to code using python programming language.
       These are some of the things we have learn't.
       <ul>
        <li> Where is python programming language used</li>
        <li> Commands for the terminal</li>
        <li> Key feature of python</li>
        <li>Python Operators</li>
        <li>How to use python shell</li>
       </ul>
    </p>
       <h3>Product Management</h3>
       This class is interesting. To understand it, you need to have an understanding of all the other classes as they 
        are most interconnected in this class. Product management is overseeing the whole process of a product development from 
        the time the problem is defined to the time the solution is created i.e the product is created.
